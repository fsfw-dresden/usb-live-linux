The config_dresden_schulproxy 99-dresden-schulen network dispatcher script did
not stop setting up firewall redirection in case the redsocks proxy service
would not start up successfully, which never occurred for six years - until the
school proxy apparently was switched off this summer.

This hotfix can be applied to live sticks already in circulation to block the
script.
