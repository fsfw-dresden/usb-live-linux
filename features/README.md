## Features in usb-live-linux

Although this construct was inspired by the [features folder in tails](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/tree/features), it works differently. While tails describes feature scenarios / test cases, here the individual features are the actual meat, i.e. the scripts and scaffolding that implement the feature.
Each feature can be included by a relative symlink in the features folder of a [build variant](../variants.build).
Each variant can also define its own private features there instead of sym-linking from this common features folder.

### Mappings of feature folders to live-build config hierarchy
The folders contained in a feature have been named to make them easily understandable. They will be translated to their target live-build folder when scripts/apply-build-variant.sh is being run in the build process. The path mappings are as follows:

    package-preferences => config/archives
    package-repos => config/archives
    package-include => config/packages.chroot
    livefs-hooks => config/hooks/normal
    livefs-include => config/includes.chroot
    live-build-config => config
    user-config => config/includes.chroot/etc/skel
    packages.apt => config/package-lists
    packages.md => (scripts/md2packagelist.sh) => config/package-lists

### Naming
The feature names try to be as descriptive and concise as possible.

### Scope prefixes
Each feature name starts with a scope prefix. For that, there are no defined rules yet, current (2020-10-10) distribution of prefixes (including several unreleased features) is as follows:

     88 config
     48 app
     44 package-list
     10 workaround
     10 live
      9 package-repo
      9 desktop
      4 package-preference
      4 lang
      4 hook
      2 live-boot
      2 driver
      1 stuff
      1 menu-override
      1 firmware
      1 debug
      1 appimage

### Dependencies
Package dependencies are listed line-by-line in a plain text file "packages.apt".
A feature can depend on another feature by putting a relative symlink to it into a folder "depends".
