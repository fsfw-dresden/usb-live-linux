# Overview

This directory contains some examples to disburden the process of getting started with Go programming.

In fact, go has an excellent documentation: [https://golang.org/doc/](https://golang.org/doc/).
The present examples are not meant as replacement but shall enable you to get some immediate positive result.

Currently there is only one very simple example but this hopefully changes in the future.
See the respective [github-repo](https://github.com/fsfw-dresden/hello-world-collection) for updates.
Of course you are welcome to suggest additional content by your self, e. g., via pull request.
