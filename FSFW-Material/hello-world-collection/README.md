# Overview

This repository collects material which aims to make it easier to get started with programming.
Currently the following languages are covered (see README.md files in each directory):

* [Python](python/README.md)
* [C](C/README.md)
* [Go](go/README.md)
* [Ada](ada/README.md)

**Note**: You can use the command `grip` to render markdown files (like this one).

This repository is part of the [*FSFW-Uni-Stick*-Project](https://github.com/fsfw-dresden/usb-live-linux)
but might be interesting on its own.


For all examples it is necessary to have a terminal open in the appropriate directory.
One way to achive this: Pressing Shift+F4 in Dolphin (opens a new terminal in the currently shown directory).
Basic commands:
* `cd <dirname>`
  - change directory to <dirname>
* `cd .. `
  - go one level up
* `ls -lha`
  - display the content of the current directory
* `tree`
  - nicely display the content of the current directory and its subdirs
* `mc`
  - open midnight commander (powerful file manager for the terminal)
