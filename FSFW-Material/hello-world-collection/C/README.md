# Overview

This directory contains some examples to disburden the process of getting started with C programming.

Currently there is only one very simple example but this hopefully changes in the future.
See the respective [github-repo](https://github.com/fsfw-dresden/hello-world-collection) for updates.
Of course you are welcome to suggest additional content by your self, e. g., via pull request.

* 01_hello-world

# TODO:
Add examples for the following topics

* nontrivial linking
