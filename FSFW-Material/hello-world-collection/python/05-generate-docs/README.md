# General Information

The directory `05-generate-docs` is an example for the automatic generation of software documentation
based on docstrings in the source code by means of the tool [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org).

The subdirectory `fsfw_demo_package` contains the example code which is to be documented.

The content of the subdirectory `doc` was generated in the following steps:
1. Execution of `sphinx-quickstart`. Thereby some parameters have to be provided interactively (see below).
2. Editing of `doc/source/conf.py`, such that the python package which shall be documented (`fsfw_demo_package`) is in the search path.
3. Execution of `sphinx-apidoc -f -o doc/source fsfw_demo_package/`. This generates the relevant files in the directory `doc/source`.
4. Editing of `doc/source/index.rst` such that these files and intro.rst (created manually) are included.
5. Execution of `make html` inside the directory `doc`. This generates the documentation in HTML format inside `doc/build`.
 (Result: see `doc/build/html/index.html`). *Note*: It might be necessary to run the command `make html` twice.

The content of the manual editing can be retraced, e.g., with the following commands
* `kdiff3 conf.py_original conf.py`
* `kdiff3 index.rst_original index.rst`

More information on this topic is available for example in the  [Sphinx Tutorial](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/tutorial.html).
*Note*: Sphinx ca be configured such that code examples contained in docstrings are executed and their results (text, graphics)
are included in the generated docs, e.g., see
[this scipy function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.bode.html).
