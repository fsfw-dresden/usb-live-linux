Introduction
============

This text is part of the documentation demo, which serves mainly to demonstrate how to automatically
generate nice documentaion directly from source code.

.. note::  This particular chapter does not come from source code but from the file ``intro.rst``,
           which was manually written by the `FSFW <https://fsfw-dresden.de>`_.

For more information on generating documentaion with sphinx see the
`tutorial <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/tutorial.html>`_.
